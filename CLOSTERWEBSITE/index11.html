<p>Description: "The Closter Nature Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides educational and environmental programs to the public. It encompasses 136 acres of forested wetlands, meadows, ponds, and brooks. Our grounds are open dawn to dusk, 365 days a year.  </p>

<p>My Experience: 
The nature center is very nostalgic to me. I remember seeing several interesting animals such as iguanas, lizards, and turtles. The place is very scenic and by a lake which makes it ideal for a sunny day out.  </p>
