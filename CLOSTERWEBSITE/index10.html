<p>Description: We are very excited to introduce to you Wards5and10.com

    The entire inventory available at Ward's 5 & 10 will eventually be available here on our website. Over 12,360 of our best items are already on the site.
    
    We have worked hard to bring people the things they need and great deals on a wide variety of goods since our store first opened in 1960. Little did we know that 50 years later, we'd be bringing these same great deals to the entire country.
    
    It is our pleasure to serve you so we hope that you take the time to browse the entire store. As our local customers say, "You never know what you'll find at Ward's. This place has everything"  </p>

<p>My Experience: 
This is a great department store! It has such a good selection of necessities and also a great candy selection. I appretiate its 1960s vibe that really differenciates it from other department stores.  </p>
