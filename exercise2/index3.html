        <h1>More About the Handmade Web</h1>
        <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
            relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
            Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
            influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a word-processed
            photocopied booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
            trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
            The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
            about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
            Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF trAces: A
            Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)
            One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
            how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
            archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
            manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
            — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
            within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
            change. </p>
