    <h1><a href="index.html">CLOSTER</a></h1>

<h1>Northern Valley Demerest Regional Highschool </h1>
<p>
    Address: 150 Knickerbocker Rd, Demarest, NJ 07627
</p>

<p>Description: Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest is a comprehensive four-year public high school serving students from several municipalities in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The high school serves students from the suburban communities of Closter, Demarest, and Haworth.
<p>My Experience: 
This is my highschool. I overall enjoyed it and feel there was a solid education system that prepped me for college. I do feel however, the parking space could be improved and it was impossible for my friends/parents to go in and out without facing issues in the tight lot! </p>
