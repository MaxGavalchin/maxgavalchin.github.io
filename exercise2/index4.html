                    <h1>Ghost of Browsers</h1>
                    <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
                        Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
                        channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
                        generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in
                        
                        modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of dated web-
                        design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages
                        
                        optimised for lower resolutions now take less than a third of the screen. Ghosts of browsers past
                        mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
                        automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.
                        For example, M.D. Coverleyâ€™s The Personalization of Complexity (2001) "explores the ways in
                        which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
                        sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
                        on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
                        many of the features in this essay.
                        These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
                        web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making. </p>
